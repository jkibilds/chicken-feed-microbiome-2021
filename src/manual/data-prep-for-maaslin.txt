# After running MaAsLin2 and getting the results:
# How to link significant features (identified by MaAsLin2) with taxonomy:
qiime metadata tabulate --m-input-file results/taxonomy.qza --o-visualization results/taxonomy.qzv
# export or save this taxonomy table as TSV from interactive view: feature-taxonomy-tabulated.tsv
# then find the taxonomies manually, unless there are so many to require a script
# a script like src/local/add_tax_to_maaslin.sh can be used to automate adding taxonomy to MaAsLin2 output
