RPCA (DEICODE)

When sorted, often referred to as biclustering, this method results in a table that reveals which taxa are driving the clustering seen in the ordinations.

The highest loaded features (most positively ranked and most negatively ranked) correspond to the most influential taxa driving the clustering.

The resulting optimized parameters are optimized rank (number of clusters), the intensity of noise, sequencing depth, the distribution parameters μ and σ, and overlap of features between clusters (i.e., effect size).

RPCA was run with a rank of 2 because there were two metadata categories of interest in each comparison. - --p-n-components parametrs nozīmē ordinācijas asu skaitu, starp kurām tiks sadalīti visi 100% mainības (variance). Problēmas var rasties, ja ir metadatu gradients un līdz ar to liels skaits rank.

The percent explained variance will spread out as you increase the rank. However, the input rank does not limit the ordination to only three clusters (could be less or more), similar to PCA.

"My typical workflow includes testing out a few different distance metrics like Dice-Sorensen and Bray-Curtis to see how read abundances influence the results, as well as weighted and unweighted Unifrac to see how adding phylogenetic information skews the resulting ordinations (and permanova)."
